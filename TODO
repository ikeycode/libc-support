Ikeys TODO list:

 - Takeover from @jorio when confirmation is through
 - Use clang/llvm static analysis
 - Enforce Serpent Coding Style (C)
 - Ensure portability with musl
 - Add manpages
 - Centralise buildsystem (meson out the window as meson needs these tools.)
 - Security testing/validation
 - Tag.
